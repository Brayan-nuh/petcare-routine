                    <h3>1. Start with Basic Commands</h3>
                    <p>Begin with simple commands like “sit,” “stay,” and “come.” Use treats and positive reinforcement to build a strong foundation.</p>

                <div class="tip-card">
                    <h3>2. Be Consistent</h3>
                    <p>Consistency is key in training. Use the same commands each time to avoid confusion. Ensure everyone in your household follows the same routine.</p>

                    <p>Reward your pet with treats, praise, or toys when they obey. Avoid punishment, as it can lead to anxiety and fear.</p>
