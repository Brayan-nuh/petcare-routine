    <h1>Understanding Your Pet's Body Language</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction to Pet Body Language</h2>
        <p>Our pets communicate through body language, using their posture, facial expressions, tail, and more to express feelings and needs. By understanding their cues, we can respond better to them, ensuring they feel safe and understood. This guide covers some common body language cues for both dogs and cats.</p>

        <h2>Common Dog Body Language</h2>
        <p>Dogs express a wide range of emotions through their body language. Here are some common cues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wagging Tail:</strong> A wagging tail can indicate excitement or happiness, but a slow or low wag may mean uncertainty. Pay attention to the position and speed for clues.</li>
            <li><strong>Relaxed Ears:</strong> When a dog’s ears are relaxed and in a natural position, they’re usually calm and comfortable.</li>
            <li><strong>Raised Hackles:</strong> Raised fur along the back can indicate arousal, excitement, or even aggression. Observe other cues to understand context.</li>
            <li><strong>Play Bow:</strong> When a dog stretches their front legs forward and lowers their head, it’s a sign of wanting to play.</li>
            <li><strong>Cowering or Tucked Tail:</strong> A tucked tail, lowered body, or cowering indicates fear or submission. Give them space and a calm environment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Cat Body Language</h2>
        <p>Cats are more subtle in their body language, but they still communicate clearly. Here are some common cues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Slow Blinking:</strong> A cat slowly blinking at you is showing affection and trust. You can “blink back” to show you’re not a threat.</li>
            <li><strong>Arched Back:</strong> An arched back with fur standing up indicates fear or defensiveness. They may feel threatened and are trying to appear larger.</li>
            <li><strong>Purring:</strong> Purring usually indicates contentment, but cats may also purr when they’re in pain. Pay attention to the context.</li>
            <li><strong>Twitching Tail:</strong> A twitching or flicking tail can signal irritation or excitement. A relaxed, swaying tail typically means the cat is calm.</li>
            <li><strong>Belly Exposure:</strong> When a cat shows its belly, it indicates trust. However, it’s not always an invitation to pet, as many cats dislike belly touches.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Understanding Body Language in Other Pets</h2>
        <p>Other pets, like rabbits, birds, and small mammals, also have unique ways of communicating. For example, rabbits thump their back legs when they feel threatened, while birds may puff up their feathers when comfortable or feeling territorial.</p>
        <p>Always observe your pet’s unique habits and cues, and give them space when they show signs of discomfort.</p>
